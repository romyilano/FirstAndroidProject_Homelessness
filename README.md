# First Android Project

It's time to get around to doing a first android project. Since Android is the phone of choice for many struggling, low income and even homeless Americans, an Android app around being homeless might be a cool first idea for this demographic!

This isn't my biggest priority but it will be fun to try out React Native, etc. and spin off something good for low-income Americans.
